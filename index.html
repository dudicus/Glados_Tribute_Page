            <h2>Information about GLaDOS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>GLaDOS is a fictional artificially superintelligent computer system from the video game series Portal</li>
                <li>She was mistreated by the scientists and used a neurotoxin to kill the scientists in the laboratory before the events of Portal.</li>
                <li>The inspiration for the character's creation extends from the use of a text-to-speech program while writing lines for the video game Psychonauts.</li>
                <li>GLaDOS was originally intended to be present solely in the first area of Portal; she was well received by other designers and her role was expanded as a result.</li>
                <li>While the game was initially designed with other characters, they were later removed, leaving GLaDOS as the only character players encounter.</li>
                <li>GLaDOS has been well received by critics and gamers, some of whom called her narcissistic, passive-aggressive, sinister, and witty. She is considered one of the greatest video game characters, particularly among those created in the 2000s.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>"Good news, I figured out what that thing you just incinerated is. It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the enrichment centre with a deadly neurotoxin to make me stop flooding the enrichment centre with a deadly neurotoxin, so get comfortable while I warm up the neurotoxin emitters."</em></p>
